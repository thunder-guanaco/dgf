### Start the server

1. Activate the environment
`. env/bin/activate`

2. Install all the requirements (this could take a while the first time)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Initialize needed env vars from the secrets
`source secrets`

4. Tell application we're running locally
`export DJANGO_ENV=dev`

5. Migrate the database (this could take a while the first time)
`python manage.py migrate`

6. Run the server
`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

All of this can be done at once by running the script [run.bash]
`bash run.bash runserver`
