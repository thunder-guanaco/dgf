## About the technologies

* [Django CMS](http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/index.html)

## HOWTOs

### Set up production server

See `server_setup.bash`

### Set up the project to run locally

1. Install virtualenv

`sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv`

2. Create an environment
`python3 -m venv ./env`

3. Install MySQL and create the necessary user and tables (this code works with MySQL 8)
```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'dgf'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dgf';"
sudo mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE dgf_cms;"
sudo mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dgf_cms.* TO 'dgf'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;"
```

4. Copy the `secrets` file from the server and put it in the root folder of the project (DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE, it is ignored by [.gitignore]).

### Start the server

1. Activate the environment
`. env/bin/activate`

2. Install all the requirements (this could take a while the first time)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Initialize needed env vars from the secrets
`source secrets`

4. Tell application we're running locally
`export DJANGO_ENV=dev`

5. Migrate the database (this could take a while the first time)
`python manage.py migrate`

6. Run the server
`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

All of this can be done at once by running the script [run.bash]
`bash run.bash runserver`
